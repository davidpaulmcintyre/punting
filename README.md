# punting
This is the code that the statistics in my blog post https://wordpress.com/post/howtoember.wordpress.com/848 are based on.

In this project I compare the muff rate for left vs right footed punters. I relied on an open source kaggle dataset at  https://www.kaggle.com/maxhorowitz/nflplaybyplay2009to2016. The kaggle dataset is a compressed file of three csv files which are duplicate, updated versions of the same dataset. I use only the latest, vol 5. This repo does not include a copy of this data because the file (even in its compressed form) exceeds github's 100mb filesie limit, so you will have to download it directly from kaggle.

It uses jupyter notebook to run the code.
