# punting
This is the code that the statistics in my blog post https://wordpress.com/post/howtoember.wordpress.com/848 are based on.

In this project I compare the muff rate for left vs right footed punters. I relied on an open source kaggle dataset at  https://www.kaggle.com/maxhorowitz/nflplaybyplay2009to2016. The kaggle dataset is a compressed file of three csv files which are duplicate, updated versions of the same dataset. I use the latest, vol 5, and this repo includes a compressed version of this file and this file only.

It uses jupyter notebook to run the code.
